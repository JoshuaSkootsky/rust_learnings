## Running the programs

To run the programs, simply run the `run.sh` script with the filename of the program as an argument.

For example, to run the `count_divisors.rs` program, run the following command:

```
./run.sh count_divisors.rs
```

You can run `./run.sh clear` to remove all compiled binaries.
